1. It takes too long for the endpoint to respond when using langchain
2. I deployed Llama3.1 7B on endpoint of huggingface
3. Llama3 7B seems not support changing max input token, No instruction but only example input suggestion taken
4. Sequence of giving True, False or not sure is essential
5. when token is limited model sometimes treat 'not' and 'sure' as 2 words, so I use unsure to replace
